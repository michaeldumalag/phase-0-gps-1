# Michael Dumalag's GPS 1.1 Release 7 - Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
    - Initially I was not clearly understanding the git fetch command. After our session it become more obvious that it was very similar to pull makes your local repository current then merges, while fetch only makes you current temporarily.
**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
    - The concept that was made more clearly was the normal distinction between who makes pushes the pull requests and when the person reviewing your changes make the merge.  
**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
    - The questions I asked were primarily about navigation through git and how that works in sequence with GitHub.
**What still confuses you about Git?**
    - What confuses me about git still is when it is the correct time to make a pull request in order to work with current repository.  I will definitely have to do more research
**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
    - It was not as nerve racking as I was making it out to be in my head.  My pair and I did very well to ask the right questions.  It was definitely a good experience to have Katy as a guide in order to steer us in the correct direction. Overall great experience and I look forward to more.
